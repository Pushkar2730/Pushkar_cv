    <h2>2. Esports</h2>
    <p class="content">Esports- a lot of people are not even aware about the meaning of 'e' in this word and same is the scenario of Esports in India.
        <br>
        <div id="more2"> 'e' stands for electronic and Esports is quite popular worldwide but it is still considered as the waste of time in our country. Undoubtedly the popularity of the same is on a steady rise in India but we are still far behind as compared to other countries.
    
    <h3>  Why Esports is not popular in India?</h3>
    <p class="content">The main reason behind the same is not considering it as a career option. Most of the people are not aware about the opportunities present in Esports world. Not much organisations are ready to spend money in Indian Esports scene because of its less popularity and even lesser viewership. Mobile Esports gained massive popularity with the launch of PUBGM in India and alot of players from India represented multiple organisations on the world stage but same is not the scenario with PC Gaming which is considered as the real Esports.
    </p>
    <h3>Growth of Esports in India</h3>
<p class="content">The Esports is growing massively in India and every year the quality and quantity of active players is increasing. The count of online gamers in India also grew by 31 percent in 2019 and reached around 365 million. As per an FCCI-EY report on media and entertainment, the reach is expected to cross the 440 million mark. Players like 'Ankit Panth' are creating awareness among the poeple in India regarding the career opportunities in this field. Esports title like Valorant started giving India a reserved spot in their international event which is putting us on the world map and initiatives like this will definitely grow the Esports scene in India.</p>
